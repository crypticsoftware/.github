# Hi there 👋
Welcome to Cryptic Software's github profile.

## 🙋‍♀️ What are we?
Hello! We are Cryptic, a software development company specializing in the development of custom-made software solutions.

## 👩‍💻 What FOSS projects do we have?

At the moment, we do not have any open source projects available, but that is about to change. Several projects are in the works and will be released soon. These projects will allow developers and users to collaborate on creating innovative, open-source applications that can be used and shared by the entire community. Open source projects provide a platform for developers to share their ideas and create something new and beneficial for everyone. In the near future, we will have a variety of open source projects to choose from, which will give developers the ability to work together and bring new products to the market more quickly.
